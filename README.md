Hi, I'm Kirill â€” a Software Engineer at [Google](https://about.google/) working
on [Clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org), C++ Language Server implementation that
helps you write better code in Visual Studio Code, Vim and other editors.  I
specialize in Compilers and Machine Learning. C++ and Python are typically my
languages of choice, but I enjoy writing code in Rust and Haskell. I contribute
to [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) very often ([my
commits](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commits?author=kirillbobyrev)).

Before I joined Google full-time I was studying at the university and interning
at Google, too. I enjoy building products and so I'm naturally interested in
startups. While at university, I was doing Machine Learning and building
[Handl](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/13504), Machine Learning startup
backed by [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/).

Outside of work I enjoy reading (see latest books in my Goodreads
[profile](https://www.goodreads.com/kirillbobyrev)), art, chess and competitive
programming.
