# Kirill Bobyrev

Hi, I'm Kirill â€” a Software Engineer at [Google](https://about.google/) working
on [Clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org), C++ Language Server implementation that
helps you write better code in Visual Studio Code, Vim and other editors.  I
specialize in Compilers and Machine Learning. C++ and Python are typically my
languages of choice, but I also enjoy playing with Rust and learning Haskell.
Most of work is open source and in the [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) land
([list](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commits?author=kirillbobyrev) of
my commits).

Before I joined Google full-time I was studying at the university and
interning at Google, too. I enjoy building products and so I'm naturally
interested in startups. While at university, I was doing Machine Learning and
building [Handl](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/13504),
Machine Learning startup backed by [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/),
as a non-founding member.

I graduated with a Bachelor Degree in Mathematics and Physics from
[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology](https://mipt.ru/english/about/about-mipt/)
(consistently the best university in Russia) in 2019. During my time at the
university I was focusing on Mathematical Optimization, the foundation of
Machine Learning.

Outside of work I enjoy reading (see latest books in my Goodreads
[profile](https://www.goodreads.com/kirillbobyrev)), art, chess and martial
arts (Jiu-Jitsu and Muay Thai).
