I'm a Software Engineer at [Waymo](https://waymo.com/), an autonomous driving
technology company. I work on [Simulation
City](https://blog.waymo.com/2021/06/SimulationCity.html) - it helps train and
test autonomous driving systems and is critical for the safety of self-driving
cars that we deploy. Before that I worked at Google on
[clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org) and Clang/LLVM.
