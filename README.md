I'm a Software Engineer at [Waymo](https://waymo.com/), an autonomous driving
technology company. I work on [Simulation
City](https://blog.waymo.com/2021/06/SimulationCity.html) --- it helps train and
test autonomous driving systems and is critical for the safety of self-driving
cars that we deploy. Before that I worked on [clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org)
and Clang/LLVM at Google.

Outside of work I enjoy reading (see latest books in my Goodreads
[profile](https://www.goodreads.com/kirillbobyrev)), art, chess and competitive
programming.
