I'm a Software Engineer at [Waymo](https://waymo.com/) where we build self-driving
cars. I work on [Simulation City](https://blog.waymo.com/2021/06/SimulationCity.html)
- it helps train and test autonomous driving systems and is critical for the safety of
self-driving cars that we deploy. Before Waymo I worked at Google on
[clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org) and Clang + LLVM.
